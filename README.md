### Basic Information

The Module 4 Challenge was completed by the support of the course materials, 
as well as a tutoring session.  I feel confident that my code is accurate, 
however the receipts do not match up with my totals in the later half of the 
excercise.  I am curious if the calculations are accurate in the provided 
receipts, their shipping calculations may be different than what is directed. 
Regardless, the main code is seemingly sound outside of the calculations vs. 
receipts.
