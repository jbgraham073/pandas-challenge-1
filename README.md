### Basic Information

I have updated my files and code appropriately for my attempt 4. Please see summary below:

Based on my findings, the top client id, considering total profit, qty, and total revenue, was Client 78965.  Thier profit based on the findings ended up being $253M!  This was largely driven by the large quantity of units that they purchased compaired to the rest of the dataset.
